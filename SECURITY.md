# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is pre-1.0 and under active development.

- Supported: latest `main` branch commit
- Not supported: older commits, forks, and unpublished local builds

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Use GitHub's private reporting flow instead:

1. Go to the repository **Security** tab.
2. Select **Report a vulnerability**.
3. Include:
   - affected crate(s) and file(s)
   - reproduction steps / proof of concept
   - impact and threat model assumptions
   - suggested fix (if available)

If private reporting is unavailable, contact the maintainer via GitHub profile contact details and include `[SECURITY]` in the title.

## Response Expectations

- Initial triage response target: within **5 business days**
- Status update target: every **7 business days** while open
- Fix timeline depends on severity and release constraints

## Disclosure Guidelines

- Coordinate disclosure with maintainers.
- Avoid publishing exploit details before a fix or mitigation is available.
- Credit reporters in release notes unless anonymity is requested.
